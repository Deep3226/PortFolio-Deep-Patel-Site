            The main purpose of our project is to automate the industrial level tasks which are redundant, takes time,
             require human attention each and every time. Implementation of this project will reduce maximun
              circumstances as well as save money.Automation of the IT industrial operations that are repetitive and
              require human attention each and every time using Ansible framework. Using this framework, we can
               automate the configuration of firewall, server, router and database server to deploy any services by 
               just running a YAML and python script.â€¢	Tasks such as the addition of hosts in Load Balancer, assigning
             IP addresses to these hosts etc are automated by implementing our project in the IT industry. These tasks
              are carried out simultaneously, hence the operation time, human effort, capital investment is reduced.
